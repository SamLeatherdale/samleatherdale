### Hi, I'm Sam Leatherdale.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Atlassian](https://github.com/atlassian). I love working on programming and web projects in my spare time, most of which are showcased right here on my GitHub page, or on my portfolio at [https://samleatherdale.com](https://samleatherdale.com).
